# ðŸŽ“ SchoolsDB â€“ School Management Database System

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
The **SchoolsDB** project is a relational database system designed to manage and organize key information within a school environment. It handles data about **departments, teachers, students, courses, classrooms, schedules, and enrollments**, providing a structured way to store and connect relationships among them.

This project was developed for **CIS 344 â€“ Database Design** under **Prof. Yanilda Peralta Ramos** at CUNY during **Fall 2025** by **Rokia Touray**.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Objectives
- Design a database schema for a school system using **MySQL Workbench**.
- Model entities and their relationships using both **Chen** and **UML ER diagrams**.
- Implement and forward-engineer the database into **MySQL** using SQL scripts.
- Demonstrate understanding of **database normalization, foreign keys, and constraints**.

## ðŸ§© Entities and Relationships

| Entity | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Departments** | Contains department names and office locations. |
| **Teachers** | Stores teacher information and their assigned department. |
